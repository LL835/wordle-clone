# Wordle Challenge
## Overview
This project was made as part of a coding challenge. The challenge required:

- Breaking Wordle into separate user stories. (See [Issues #1 to #7](https://github.com/LL835/wordle-clone/issues).)
- Attempting to recreate one of those user stories. (See [Issue #1](https://github.com/LL835/wordle-clone/issues/1).)

The attempted user story for this project is the user input feature: that is, allowing users to enter their guess with the virtual keyboard or their device's keyboard.
